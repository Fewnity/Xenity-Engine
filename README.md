> [!WARNING]
> The engine is not finished. So you may encounter problems during game development like:
> - Deleting Meta files will have repercussions on your project. Variables that reference the files will be emptied.
> - Duplicating a meta file will cause problems, each meta file has a unique file id in it.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to compile a game in the editor, you have to change set `Compiler path` in the `Engine Settings` menu (Window->Engine Settings). You can set the `PPSSPP location` for Build And Run for PSP builds.
> `Compiler path` is by default `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build`, change this if your Visual Studio installation/version is different.

## How to use the editor
### How to play the game in the editor
- Compile the game in "Game->Compile Game"
- Click on the play button
### How to build the game
- Open the Build Settings menu in "File->Build Settings"
- Select the platform
- Click on build
(For PSP, PS3 and PsVita, you will need Docker Desktop installed and configured).

## Docker Setup
Docker Desktop is needed to compile PSP, PS3 and PsVita games.<br>
Download Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

Then finish the docker install in Xenity. Go in "Window->Docker Configuration", the process can take several minutes especially if you have a slow computer or a slow internet connection.

## Compatible files
Images: `.png .jpg .bmp`

Audio: `.wav .mp3` (Please use 44100Hz audio except on PS3, you have to use 48000Hz audio)

Mesh: `.obj .fbx`

Font: `.ttf`

## How to compile the engine in Visual Studio
- Set the project `Xenity_Engine_Executable` as startup project.
- Compile `Engine` configuration then `Editor` to generate all dll files.

## How the engine internally works

When a project/game is loaded, the engine will make a list of all existing files. Each file has an unique Id.
Classes that are originally a file like `Texture`, `Audio Clip`, `Mesh Data` and more, inherit from `File Reference` to have a pointer to their file.

Some classes like `Component`, `GameObject`, `Vector3` and more, inherit from `Reflective`. This allow to access their variables without knowing the base class. This is used by the Inspector to see and modify data and used to save/load their data in/from a file.
