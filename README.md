> [!WARNING]
> The engine is far from finished. So there are many problems you may encounter during game development.
> - A project can be corrupted if a bug append during file read/write (maybe caused by the write access is enabled even if we want only to read a file).
  Meta files maybe be blank, so keep a save of your project.
> - If you compile the engine in Visual Studio, Hot Reloading will not be available. The engine will not be able to load DLLs, so the game code should be in Visual Studio project instead of the game project folder.
> - Deleting Meta files will have repercussions on your project. Variables that reference the files will be emptied.
> - Do not duplicate a meta file, each meta file has a unique file id in it.
