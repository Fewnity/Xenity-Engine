> [!WARNING]
> The engine is not perfect. So you may encounter problems during game development like:
> - Deleting Meta files will have repercussions on your project. Variables that reference the files will be emptied.
> - Duplicating a meta file will cause problems, each meta file has a unique file id in it.
> - Audio works "fine" with 44100Hz but on PS3 you need to use 48000Hz audio.

You can see all limitations [here](./limitations.md).
