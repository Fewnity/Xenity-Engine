# Limitations

Lighting does not work great on PsVita and PS3.
 - Performances are not great
 - Lights on PS3 are limited by 1 on each type

Audio works "fine" with 44100Hz but on PS3 you need to use 48000Hz audio or the audio will sound weird.

The engine is mono thread, so performances are not great with lot of objects.

Objects with a big scale will cause lags if they are moving (Problem caused the light world partitionner)
